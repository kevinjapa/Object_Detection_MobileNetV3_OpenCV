# SSD MobileNetV3 Object Detection Using OpenCV and C++

OpenCV, SSD_MobileNetV3 and C++ enable the development of a fast and accurate object detection app that can run on resource-constrained devices. 
The app can process real-time video streams and identify objects in the scene, such as people, animals, and vehicles. 
The detected objects can then be tracked and analyzed to provide useful insights or trigger specific actions.
